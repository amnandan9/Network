    <h1>📡 802.11n Wi-Fi Standard</h1>
    <p>802.11n is a Wi-Fi standard under the IEEE 802.11 family, introduced in <strong>2009</strong>. It improved wireless networking significantly over its predecessor (<strong>802.11g</strong>) by using <strong>MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)</strong> technology, which allows multiple antennas to send and receive data simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Key Features of 802.11n:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Speed:</strong> Supports data rates up to <strong>600 Mbps</strong> (with four spatial streams).</li>
        <li>📡 <strong>Frequency Bands:</strong> Operates in both <strong>2.4 GHz</strong> and <strong>5 GHz</strong> bands (dual-band support).</li>
        <li>📶 <strong>MIMO Technology:</strong> Uses multiple antennas to improve speed and reliability.</li>
        <li>📏 <strong>Channel Bonding:</strong> Can use <strong>40 MHz</strong> channels for higher throughput (compared to 20 MHz in earlier standards).</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> Works with older <strong>802.11a/b/g</strong> devices.</li>
        <li>📈 <strong>Better Range & Reliability:</strong> Improved signal strength and reduced interference.</li>
    </ul>
